BOM REPORT JOB

INTRODUCTION:
---------------------------------
This utility generates BOM reports through Job Processor.  The reports are rendered as PDF, or XLS, or XLSX files and attached to the item.

REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------------------
- Vault Professional 2020 (or previous, if switched to legacy branch)
- Must have job queue enabled.
- Must have a “Quick Change” (name to be provided in settings.xml file) state that the plug-in can use to move the item to edit mode.
- Must have a folder in Vault for storing the generated reports.

TO CONFIGURE:
---------------------------------
1. Extract the Binary Archive (*.7z) to the installation folder according the Vault version: %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 20xx\Extensions\BOMReportJob
2. Go to the install location, which is %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 20xx\Extensions\BOMReportJob.
3. Copy to this folder the RDLC file you want to use when generating reports.  You can skip this step if you want to use one of the default RDLC files which are already in the BOMReportJob folder.
4. Open Settings.xml in a text or XML editor.  Set all the values according to your configuration.  Instructions are in the XML file.
5. Save Settings.xml and exit the editor.
6. Exit Job Processor if it is running.
7. Start Job Processor.
8. Go to Administration->Job Types.  You should see an entry for  “Autodesk.BOMReport”.
9. Edit a lifecycle transition, navigate to Custom Job tab and set “Autodesk.BOMReport” as the Job Type on transitions where you want reports to be created.
10. Start Vault Explorer.
11. Run an assembly through one of the configured lifecycle transitions.
12. Check the job queue.  You should see an Autodesk.BOMReport for each item in the assembly.
13. After the Job Processor handles the jobs, the queue should be empty.  The assembly items should have Reports attached to them; if the option <generatePartReports> is set to True also part items should have reports attached. 

FEATURES:
---------------------------------
- BOMReportJobs can be triggered from changes to item lifecycle
- There are three formats that can be used when printing out BOM information:
-- MULTI_LEVEL - This is the full, ordered BOM tree.
-- FIRST_LEVEL - This is for all items immeditaly belows the root.  Anyting deeper in the BOM is omitted.  Order is not guaranteed.
-- PARTS_ONLY - This only shows the leaf nodes of the BOM tree.  Order is not guaranteed.

NOTES:
---------------------------------
- Only one RDLC file can be used.
- Output files will be named after the Item Number off of the corresponding Item.
- The setting 'attachUpdateReport' (new in 22.0.4.0) requires matching pre-conditions if it is changed after a time: 
	- existing attachments will no longer update, but not get deleted if the setting is set from true to false
	- existing reports not being attached will not get attached by the change of the variable from false to true; existing reports need to get attached manually in this case.
